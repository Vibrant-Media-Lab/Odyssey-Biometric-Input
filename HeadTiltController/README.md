# Odyssey-Biometric-Input

Here are some basic instructions to use the head tilt controller.

    Turn on the odyssey and connect game 4
    Plug the usb into power
    Tilt the board to the right and use the top most and bottom most buttons to move the player to the desired position on screen, then press the middle button to confirm
    Then repeat for the other 3 directions by tilting the player left, up and down and following the same procedure above to calibrate those positions.
    Once youâ€™re done the player should be able to be controlled by the controller. 

Right now there is a slight software bug the requires you to hold the board with the buttons facing down but will have to be fixed in the future.
